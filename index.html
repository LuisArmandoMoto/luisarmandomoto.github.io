      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm Luis Armando Macías Moto, a student of Applied Mathematics and a graduate in Linguistics, with a deep interest in data, language, and logic.</p>
      <p>I focus on Business Intelligence and data visualization, working with tools like Power BI, Python, and SQL to turn raw information into clear, actionable insights.</p>
      <p>My background combines analytical precision with communication skills, allowing me to connect data with people.</p>
      <p>I'm currently building a portfolio of real-world projects, and I'm open to collaborations, professional opportunities, and continuous learning.</p>

      <h2>Curriculum Vitae</h2>

      <h3>Education</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics</strong> – UNAM, National Autonomous University of Mexico (in progress)
          <p>My studies focus on discrete mathematics, linear algebra, and probability theory. These areas provide the essential theoretical and practical tools for analyzing complex data structures, modeling relationships, and understanding uncertainty within datasets.</p>
          <p>This mathematical foundation strengthens my skills in algorithm development, data interpretation, and problem-solving, which are key in business intelligence and data analysis. By combining these mathematical disciplines with my background in linguistics, I am equipped to approach data-driven challenges with a unique perspective that blends formal reasoning with real-world applications.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>B.A. in Linguistics</strong> – UAM, Metropolitan Autonomous University (2019–2024)
          <p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in Linguistics from the Metropolitan Autonomous University (UAM), where I developed a deep interest in neurolinguistics and, later, in computational linguistics. My main academic focus has always been syntax and semantics, which shaped my analytical thinking and my fascination with the intersection between language and systems.</p>
          <p>This curiosity led me to explore how linguistic structures can be modeled computationally and how natural language can be processed and analyzed through data-driven methods. These experiences naturally paved the way toward my current focus on business intelligence and data analysis, where I apply similar principles of structure, meaning, and pattern recognition to extract insights from complex datasets.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>AI Trainer – Language Models</strong><br />
          Outlier.org (Remote) | Mar. 2024 – Present
          <p>As an AI Trainer, I worked on two main domains: linguistics and mathematics. On the linguistic side, I curated and structured datasets to improve the semantic consistency, fluency, and contextual understanding of large language models. I designed prompts and evaluated responses for tasks involving natural language generation, paraphrasing, and question answering.</p>
          <p>In the mathematics area, I supported the development of AI models by reviewing, completing, and evaluating mathematical explanations, exercises, and instructional content. This included not only solving problems but also crafting clear and pedagogically sound step-by-step solutions. I also contributed to the design of content that demonstrated or explained how to prove mathematical theorems, ensuring both formal rigor and educational value.</p>
          <p>This role allowed me to consolidate my academic foundations in both language and mathematics, and to apply them in a highly interdisciplinary environment. It strengthened my ability to break down complex concepts, model them precisely, and bridge the gap between human communication and computational logic.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clinical Research Intern</strong><br />
          Hospital Manuel Gea González | Jun. 2023 – Jan. 2024
          <p>
            During my internship at Hospital Manuel Gea González, which served as my social service requirement for my Linguistics degree, I played an active role in supporting clinical research projects focused on improving patient outcomes. My primary responsibilities included assisting with patient recruitment, ensuring strict adherence to ethical protocols and confidentiality standards to protect sensitive health information.
          </p>
          <p>
            I maintained accurate and organized clinical records, which were essential for the integrity and reproducibility of ongoing studies. Additionally, I participated in the collection of clinical data, carefully documenting observations and measurements according to study protocols.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond administrative tasks, I contributed to preliminary statistical analysis, helping the research team to identify trends and patterns within the data. This involved using basic statistical tools to summarize findings and support experimental design decisions. I also assisted in creating simple visualizations to represent data clearly for presentations and reports.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through this experience, I gained valuable insight into the clinical research process, the importance of ethical compliance, and the critical role of precise data management. It also enhanced my ability to work collaboratively within multidisciplinary teams and strengthened my skills in data handling, visualization, and scientific documentation.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Analyst</strong><br />
          Zensitud – Online Psychology Platform | Jan. 2021 – Apr. 2022
          <p>This was my first professional role focused on data analysis and visualization. At Zensitud, an online platform dedicated to mental health and psychological well-being, I was responsible for transforming raw user data into actionable insights that informed key business decisions. I worked with a dataset of over 2,000 users, analyzing behavioral patterns, engagement metrics, and content interaction using Python and SQL.</p>
          <p>In addition to backend analysis, I developed interactive dashboards in Power BI that visualized trends in session attendance, user retention, and therapy module completion. These dashboards allowed the executive team to monitor platform performance in real time and to identify areas for improvement in content strategy and user experience.</p>
          <p>My reports helped uncover usage trends across different demographics and time periods, which led to targeted content restructuring and scheduling. As a result, Zensitud achieved a 10% increase in revenue and a notable rise in user engagement and satisfaction. This project strengthened my ability to turn complex data into strategic narratives, and it deepened my understanding of how data-driven insights can directly impact digital health services.</p>
