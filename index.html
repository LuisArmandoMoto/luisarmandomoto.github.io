        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm Luis Armando Macías Moto, a student of <strong>Applied Mathematics</strong> and a graduate in <strong>Linguistics</strong>, with a deep interest in data, language, and logic.</p>
        <p>I focus on <strong>Business Intelligence</strong> and <strong>data visualization</strong>, working with tools like <strong>Power BI</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, and <strong>SQL</strong> to turn raw information into clear, actionable insights.</p>
        <p>My academic background combines analytical precision with communication skills. I’m used to breaking down problems, thinking through systems, and justifying every decision I make.</p>
        <p>I'm currently building a portfolio of real-world projects, and I’m open to collaboration, new challenges, and learning opportunities.</p>
        <p>Outside of academic and professional life, I have a strong interest in <strong>literature</strong>, especially authors like Borges, Cortázar, Pynchon, and Boris Vian. I’m drawn to writing that challenges structure and explores language and thought.</p>
        <p>In <strong>music</strong>, I enjoy playing <strong>bass</strong> and <strong>piano</strong>, writing songs, and performing with my band. I’ve always been interested in composition and rhythm, both as creative tools and systems of expression.</p>
        <p>My main personal passion is <strong>chess</strong>. I train regularly and compete in official FIDE-rated tournaments. Chess has shaped the way I think — I value its focus on structure, logic, and decision-making, and it influences how I approach learning and analysis in general.</p>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics</strong> – <strong>UNAM</strong>, National Autonomous University of Mexico (in progress)
            <p>My studies focus on <strong>discrete mathematics</strong>, <strong>linear algebra</strong>, and <strong>probability theory</strong>. These areas provide the essential theoretical and practical tools for analyzing complex data structures, modeling relationships, and understanding uncertainty within datasets.</p>
            <p>This mathematical foundation strengthens my skills in <strong>algorithm development</strong>, <strong>data interpretation</strong>, and <strong>problem-solving</strong>, which are key in business intelligence and data analysis. By combining these mathematical disciplines with my background in linguistics, I am equipped to approach data-driven challenges with a unique perspective that blends formal reasoning with real-world applications.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>B.A. in Linguistics</strong> – <strong>UAM</strong>, Metropolitan Autonomous University (2019–2024)
            <p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in Linguistics from the Metropolitan Autonomous University (UAM), where I developed a deep interest in <strong>neurolinguistics</strong> and, later, in <strong>computational linguistics</strong>. My main academic focus has always been <strong>syntax</strong> and <strong>semantics</strong>, which shaped my analytical thinking and my fascination with the intersection between language and systems.</p>
            <p>This curiosity led me to explore how linguistic structures can be modeled computationally and how natural language can be processed and analyzed through <strong>data-driven methods</strong>. These experiences naturally paved the way toward my current focus on <strong>business intelligence</strong> and <strong>data analysis</strong>, where I apply similar principles of structure, meaning, and pattern recognition to extract insights from complex datasets.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>AI Trainer – Language Models</strong><br />
            <strong>Outlier.org</strong> (Remote) | Mar. 2024 – Present
            <p>As an AI Trainer, I worked on two main domains: <strong>linguistics</strong> and <strong>mathematics</strong>. On the linguistic side, I curated and structured <strong>datasets</strong> to improve the semantic consistency, fluency, and contextual understanding of large language models. I designed prompts and evaluated responses for tasks involving <strong>natural language generation</strong>, <strong>paraphrasing</strong>, and <strong>question answering</strong>.</p>
            <p>In the mathematics area, I supported the development of AI models by reviewing, completing, and evaluating <strong>mathematical explanations</strong>, <strong>exercises</strong>, and <strong>instructional content</strong>. This included not only solving problems but also crafting clear and pedagogically sound step-by-step solutions. I also contributed to the design of content that demonstrated or explained how to prove <strong>mathematical theorems</strong>, ensuring both formal rigor and educational value.</p>
            <p>This role allowed me to consolidate my academic foundations in both language and mathematics, and to apply them in a highly interdisciplinary environment. It strengthened my ability to break down complex concepts, model them precisely, and bridge the gap between <strong>human communication</strong> and <strong>computational logic</strong>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Clinical Research Intern</strong><br />
            <strong>Hospital Manuel Gea González</strong> | Jun. 2023 – Jan. 2024

            <strong>Data Analyst</strong><br />
            <strong>Zensitud</strong> – Online Psychology Platform | Jan. 2021 – Apr. 2022
            <p>This was my first professional role in <strong>data analysis</strong> and <strong>visualization</strong>. At Zensitud, I analyzed behavioral data from over <strong>2,000 users</strong> using <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong>, generating reports that guided strategic decisions.</p>
            <p>I created interactive <strong>Power BI dashboards</strong> to track <strong>session attendance</strong>, <strong>user retention</strong>, and <strong>module completion</strong>. These visualizations enabled real-time performance monitoring and content improvements.</p>
            <p>The insights led to a <strong>10% revenue increase</strong> and higher user engagement. This role helped me develop the ability to turn data into decisions and understand how <strong>data-driven strategies</strong> shape digital services.</p>
